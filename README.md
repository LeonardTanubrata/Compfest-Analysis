# Compfest-Analysis (Simple EDA and Slicing for Data Compfest)

### CASE
As a team member of Compfest, you are assigned to oversee the digital activity of @compfest account on social media. Compfest is currently organizing an 'Academy & Competition' event where participants can register with following conditions: 
1. Post an Instagram post tagging @compfest
2. Applicant’s post must include all of these hashtags inside the caption : 
   #Academy #Competition #EvolveForTomorrow #CF1 #COMPFEST15
3. Applicant also need to mention 3 of their friends on the caption
4. Applicants will be selected based on engagements on their post 
   (posting more than once is allowed, but the calculation of engagement will only consider one post with the higher number)
5. Deadline for submission is on July 31st 2023 

Since the registration has been closed, the team with these problems :
1. The team would like to create a database for @compfest account tagged post for future needs, but since the data mining is conducted using ‘free tools’, the resulted data seems to need some cleaning before ingested into the database
2. From the cleaned data, the team would like to know how many participants is eligible for the event based on the T&C, and they need recommendation of 30 person to be selected
